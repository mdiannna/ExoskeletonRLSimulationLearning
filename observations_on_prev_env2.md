What’s broken (and why learning stalls)

Observation ≠ state you reward on

Your reward uses a lot of *_y values, but the observation you return contains only x’s ([hip1_x, knee1_x, foot1_x, hip2_x, knee2_x, foot2_x]). The agent can’t “see” hips/knees/feet heights it’s being judged on → non-stationary, unlearnable reward.

Action space too small / ambiguous

action_space has shape (3,), but you mutate either the left or right leg depending on step parity. That couples credit assignment to an arbitrary toggle. The agent can’t coordinate both legs in one step.

Physics-free position poking

Directly adding “torques” to x/y positions (hip1_x += hip_torque; hip1_y += hip_torque) isn’t physical. Even a toy kinematic model should use angles/velocities and integrate them, or at least separate stance/swing logic.

Reward has logic errors & contradictions

hips_distance = np.linalg.norm(self.hip1_x - self.hip2_x) → np.linalg.norm on a scalar is just abs, and the threshold > 7 is nonsensical vs your HIPS_DISTANCE=0.2.

min_dist = min(abs(self.foot1_y-self.GROUND_POS)<self.DELTA_GROUND, ...) → min of booleans, not distances.

Heavy penalties unless a foot is exactly on the ground block any swing phase, which you also partially penalize elsewhere.

degrees_inclination reward uses 100 - degrees_inclination (not abs), so negative tilt gives a larger bonus.

Division by zero risk

hips_inclination = (hip2_y - hip1_y)/(hip2_x - hip1_x) can blow up when hips align in x.

Gym API & performance gotchas

You render and plt.pause inside step and reset → training will crawl.

step returns Python lists; better return np.array(dtype=np.float32).

No seed(), no metadata, no close(). (Not fatal but good practice.)
